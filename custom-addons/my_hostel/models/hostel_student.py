    # Make sure that the compute method always assigns a value to the computed field. Otherwise, an error
    # will occur. This can happen when you have conditions in your code that sometimes fail to assign a
    # value to the computed field. This can be hard to debug.

    # It is also possible to make a non-stored computed field searchable by setting the search attribute to
    # the method name (similar to compute and inverse). Like inverse, search is also optional;
    # if you donâ€™t want to make the computed field searchable, you can skip it.
